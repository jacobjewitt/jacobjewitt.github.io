                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Jacob, a cybersecurity professional whose goal is to improve the efficiency and security of 
                        day-to-day operations. I'm always striving to grow my skills, take on new challenges, and 
                        make a real impact as part of a dedicated team. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Information Security at 
                        University College London (UCL), where I'm deepening my understanding of advanced security concepts and practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently hold a BSc in Computer Science with a 1st Class Honours from the University of East Anglia. 
                        For my final year project, I designed and developed a gamified web application to teach ethical 
                        hacking techniques such as SQL injection and XSS. I am also currently working toward my CompTIA Security+. 
                    </p>
